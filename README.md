# IntroProbTheory

This is the repository for my course "Introduction to Probability Theory". Basically, it includes various computation examples concerning probabilities and some useful functions. Further, this repository also includes some assignment tasks. 

If the course uses RStudio Cloud, a projects connected with this repository will be created and shared with the students. Participants should pull all the files before the course starts.
