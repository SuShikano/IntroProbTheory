# IntroProbTheory

This is the repository for my course "Introduction to Probability Theory". Basically, it includes various computation examples concerning probabilities and some useful functions. Further, this repository also includes some assignment tasks. 

If the course uses RStudio Cloud, individual projects will be created for each session. The contents will be identical with this repository.
